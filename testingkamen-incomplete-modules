Cucumber init -
 with default files -
 gemfile bundle -

Php Unit init -

 templated files in -




From Cleo...
-----------------

System Detection - Allow the pyramid application to detect OS, OS Version and Hardware information. Have a Factory Class
in Core which detects the running OS and looks in the module for a model which Reports itself as matching The
combination (ie "Ubuntu", "12.04"/"+ 11.10"), falling back to "any" instead of version if there's an "any" model. - DONE FULY
- Add other data like hostname, ip addresses to this

State Detection - Allow the pyramid application to detect information regarding software and configuration install
current state
- Its already providing a default status for anything that was installed via cleo
- Need the apt module, then the apt module can save both calling module and apt-program, so don't uninstall both
- all modules when installing if they are a dependency, should also save themselves as such
- this way a dependency will probably be an apt or a module

Inter module Compatibility- one model/module should be able to call another without using a line of bash with parameter
- actually is there any benefit to this? are we looking for an exit code? If we want information returned that's more
  than an exit code we'll need to stop spawning
- If the above are working, is there any benefit to not spawning?



Templating Module
-------------------
    Should accept
    - A template file location to read
    - An array, object or key/value file of replacements
    - a target path/name for file
    - a owner for target file (optional)
    - a group for target file (optional)
    - a permission for target file (optional)

    DONE
